How do banks interact with cryptocurrency exchanges? How do regulatory regimes differ across continents? Why is buying Bitcoin sometimes so hard?</i><b><br>- Miha Grccar (Bitstamp)<br>- Hiroyuki Mihara (Bitbank)<br>- Hugh Madden (BC Group)<br>- Kayvon Pirestani (Coinbase)<br>- Moderated by: Angie Lau (Forkast.News)</b><br><br></td>

Various competing models for self-custody exist, such as hot/cold wallet solutions and multisignature with or without an external party. Additionally, external experts provide consulting, services and even fully custodial solutions. What makes cryptocurrencies so difficult to secure? Can they be insured?

Is privacy at risk?<br>In this session, our favourite "bleeding edge" digital lawyer Urszula McCormack will summarise the 8 key things you need to know.</i><b><br>- Urszula McCormack (KWM)</b><br><br></td>

The ICO boom of 2017 has demonstrated that there is plenty of money looking for new and innovative investments, yet failed to demonstrate even short term sustainability. How will tokens legally and technologically evolve? Are Security Tokens and Initial Exchange Offerings something new, or more of the same? How will these new ideas compete with traditional instruments like stocks or bonds?</i><b><br>- Liam Bussel<br>- Nathan Kaiser (Cardano Foundation)<br>- Terence Tsang (Tidebit)<br>- Brian Liston (Seed CX)</b><br><br></td>
